## 1 Align genomes to reference

Align each assembly to the reference using [anchorwave](https://github.com/baoxingsong/AnchorWave).

## 2 Assemble a gvcf

Individual `.maf` files need to be converted to `.gvcf` and then combined to a single `.gvcf`. We recommend doing this separately by chromosome. 
Instructions for these steps are [here](https://github.com/baoxingsong/AnchorWave/blob/master/doc/GATK.md).

## 3 Clean gvcf
