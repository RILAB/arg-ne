## Repo Rules

- After completing each user request that changes files, ask whether to create a git commit and whether to push it.
- If a commit is requested, use a message that summarizes all changes since the last commit.
- Do not ask for permission to run other git commands (for example `git add`, `git status`, `git diff`) that are part of completing a commit.
